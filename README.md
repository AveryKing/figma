This project turns the provided Figma design into a deployable Next.js application (App Router) that can be shipped directly to Vercel.

## Running the code

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Create a production build
   ```bash

   ```
4. Preview the production build locally (optional)
